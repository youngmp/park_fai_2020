# park_fai_2020
Code for Park and Fai, paper to be submitted 2020

We require the following programs/libraries:
Python3 + numpy, scipy, matplotlib.

If one wants to reproduce the XPPAUT .dat files, you will need 
XPPAUT version 8 (http://www.math.pitt.edu/~bard/xpp/xpp.html) and follow the mini tutorial here https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sHhuRor1b937iw7GiIRfmJ13KYhhsLeQu84tbvYQrqw/edit?usp=sharing

generate_figures.py creates all figures using scripts and data in this github directory. It will also create a trash file called junk.png which is needed to extract the scientific notation for axis labels. it may be deleted at any time.
