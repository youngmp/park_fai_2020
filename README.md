We require the following programs/libraries:
Python3 + numpy, scipy, matplotlib.

Run generate_figures.py using Python 3 to reproduce all figures. Functions in this file are meant to serve as documentation: to understand how the various libraries are called, follow the function calls in generate_figures.py. The script will create a file called junk.png which is needed to extract the scientific notation for axis labels. it may be deleted at any time.

Some colors were added using inkscape. If you wish to edit them, import using Poppler/Cairo or else the fonts will not look right. The color-edited inkscape images are in svg format in the inkscape folder.

If one wants to reproduce the XPPAUT .dat files, you will need 
XPPAUT version 8 (http://www.math.pitt.edu/~bard/xpp/xpp.html) and follow the mini tutorial here https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sHhuRor1b937iw7GiIRfmJ13KYhhsLeQu84tbvYQrqw/edit?usp=sharing

My code tends to be verbose. You will see all kinds of outputs and error messages. If the figures generate, there is no problem. Please contact me directly (ypark at brandeis dot edu) if you run into issues.
